## How to Ask Great Questions

The better your question, the better the answer you'll get. Here's how to ask effectively:

### ✅ Be Specific

**Instead of:** "I need help"
**Try:** "I'm stuck on Project 2, Step 3. I don't understand how to apply the AIDA framework to my journey map. Can you explain?"

**Instead of:** "This doesn't work"
**Try:** "I'm trying to run my Python code in Colab and getting a 'NameError'. Here's the error message: [paste error]. What should I check?"

### ✅ Provide Context

The assistant will ask about your progress to give you the most relevant help:

**Good question structure:**
1. **Where you are**: "I'm working on Project 1, the pain point chart"
2. **What you're trying to do**: "I'm trying to format my data as JSON for Replit"
3. **What's happening**: "I'm not sure what structure the JSON should have"
4. **What you've tried**: "I looked at the example but mine has different categories"

### ✅ Ask Follow-Up Questions

If the first answer doesn't fully clarify:
- "Can you explain that part about [X] in more detail?"
- "Can you give me an example of how to apply that?"
- "What if my situation is [different scenario]?"

### ✅ Request Specific Formats

The assistant can present information in different ways:
- "Can you create a step-by-step checklist?"
- "Can you summarize this in bullet points?"
- "Can you show me a code example with comments?"
- "Can you break this into simpler terms?"

## Example Conversations

Here are some effective ways to use the assistant:

### Example 1: Understanding a Deliverable

**You:** "What do I need to submit for Project 1?"

**Assistant:** "For Project 1, you need to submit:
1. PNG image of your pain-point chart
2. Your Replit Dev URL
3. A 1-sentence takeaway about what you learned from the data

These should be submitted according to the instructions in the final step of Project 1. Are you clear on how to create each of these, or would you like help with a specific part?"

**You:** "How do I get the PNG image from Replit?"

**Assistant:** "In your Replit chart app, there's a download button that saves your chart as a PNG file..." [continues with specific instructions]

---

### Example 2: Technical Troubleshooting

**You:** "I'm having trouble with the radar chart in Replit. The code isn't displaying anything."

**Assistant:** "Let me help you troubleshoot. A few questions:
1. What error message are you seeing (if any)?
2. Did you paste your JSON data into the prompt when creating the app?
3. Is the Replit app running (do you see it in the preview panel)?

Let me know these details and I can guide you through fixing it."

**You:** "There's no error, but the preview panel is blank. I did paste the JSON."

**Assistant:** "If the preview is blank with no errors, try these steps:
1. Click the 'Stop' button and then 'Run' again to restart the app
2. Check the Console tab for any warnings
3. Make sure you clicked 'Generate app' after pasting your prompt

Also, here's the expected JSON format to double-check yours against: ..." [continues with detailed help]

### Example 3: Conceptual Understanding

**You:** "I don't really get why we're making a journey map. What's the point?"

**Assistant:** "Great question - understanding the 'why' helps you do better work.

Journey maps help businesses visualize how customers interact with their product from start to finish. For Beats by Dre, this means understanding:
- How someone first becomes aware they need headphones
- What they're thinking/feeling at each stage
- Pain points they experience along the way
- Where Beats can improve the experience

You're building this skill because journey mapping is used in marketing, UX design, product development, and consulting - it's a valuable tool for understanding human behavior.

In Project 2, you're applying the AIDA framework to structure this journey. Does this clarify why it matters, or do you have questions about the AIDA part specifically?"

---

### Example 4: Planning Your Week

**You:** "What should I be working on this week? I'm in Week 2."

**Assistant:** "In Week 2, you should be focused on Project 2: Creating a Customer Journey Map using the AIDA framework.

Here's what to prioritize:
- Step 1: Understand the AIDA framework (Awareness, Interest, Desire, Action)
- Step 2: Map your pain points from Project 1 onto this framework
- Step 3: Create your journey map visualization
- Step 4: Submit your completed map

Estimated time: 3-4 hours total across the week.

Are you starting Week 2 now, or have you already begun Project 2?"

## Tips for Getting the Most Help

### 1. Start with Conversation Starters

When you first open the assistant, you'll see suggested questions you can click. These are great starting points!

### 2. Ask "Dumb" Questions

There are no dumb questions. If you don't understand something, ask! The assistant is patient and won't judge.

### 3. Use It as a Study Tool

Before or after completing a module:
- "Can you quiz me on the key concepts from Project 3?"
- "Can you create a summary of what I learned this week?"
- "What are the most important takeaways from this step?"

### 4. Test Your Understanding

After learning something:
- "Can you give me an example scenario to practice applying this concept?"
- "How would I use this in a real-world situation?"
- "What's a common mistake people make with this?"

### 5. Get Organized

Use it for planning:
- "Can you create a checklist of everything I need to complete this project?"
- "What's the logical order to tackle these tasks?"
- "Help me prioritize what to do first"

## Understanding the Assistant's Limitations

This is an AI assistant, not a human Program Manager. Here's what that means:

**It's excellent at:**
- Finding information from the curriculum quickly
- Explaining concepts in different ways
- Providing code examples and technical help
- Being available 24/7
- Never getting tired of your questions

**It cannot:**
- Make decisions about your grades or deadlines
- Access your personal submissions or progress data
- Contact company representatives on your behalf
- Guarantee 100% accuracy (though it's very reliable)
- Understand context outside the curriculum materials

**When in doubt:**
If the assistant's answer doesn't feel right or you need human judgment, always reach out to your Program Manager on Slack.

## Privacy & Best Practices

### What to Share
- Questions about the curriculum
- General technical issues you're experiencing
- Concepts you're trying to understand

### What NOT to Share
- Personal identifying information unnecessarily
- Sensitive personal circumstances
- Login credentials or passwords

### Remember
- The assistant learns from the curriculum, not from your individual conversations
- Each conversation is separate - it doesn't track your personal progress over time
- It's a tool to help you learn, not a shortcut to avoid doing the work
